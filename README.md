**Setup project**\
install npm and node\
```sudo apt install node npm```\
or \
```sudo pacman -S node npm```

then stand in project folder and \
```npm install```

Last but not least:

``` echo "GATEWAY_PASSCODE" > .env ```\
where GATEWAY_PASSCODE is the code written on the back of the gateway. Do not commit this file!

done, make sure you're on the same network as the gateway & you're not using a VPN

**Add new lightscenes**

Scenes should be added to ```/lightshows```
